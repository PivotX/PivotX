To upgrade, you basically replace the existing "pivotx" directory with
the one from the new release. However, you want to preserve some directories
to not loose your own modifications / additions.

The recommended procedure is:

1. Unpack the release and delete the following folders:
   - pivotx/db
   - pivotx/extensions
   - pivotx/langs
   - pivotx/templates
2. On the server rename the "pivotx" folder to "pivotx.old".
   After this, your website is off-line / doesn't work until you
   have completed the procedure.
3. Upload the new "pivotx" folder to the server.
4. Move the following folders from "pivotx.old" to "pivotx":
   - db
   - extensions
   - langs
   - templates

Done! You can keep the "pivotx.old" folder a while until you are sure the
upgrade works as expected.

PS! If the upgrade fails for some reason, just 

- revert step 4 above
- delete the "pivotx" folder
- rename "pivotx.old" to "pivotx"

And you are back where you started.
